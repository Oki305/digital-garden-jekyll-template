# Frequency Distributions
Distribution tables for <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">non-grouped data</mark> .
We need to first understand each element that will be used in the table. These are:
- [[Absolute Frequency]]
- [[Relative Frequency]]
- [[Percentage Frequency]]
- [[Cumulative Absolute Frequency]]
- [[Cumulative Relative Frequency]]
- [[Cumulative Percentage Frequency]]

This applies when we have a great deal of data to work with, and it has also a considerable amount of variety. In this case, it is required to divide data into subgroups, or [[Class Ranges]]. Next step is to build [[Class Intervals]].

### Example:
Data: *2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7*

| $x_i$ | $f$ | $f_r$            | $f\%$               | $f_c$  | $f_{cr}$   | $f\%_c$     |
| ----- | --- | ---------------- | ------------------- | ------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| 2     | 3   | $3\over{20}$=.15 | $.15\cdot{100}$=15% | 3      | .15        | 15%         |
| 3     | 5   | $5\over{20}$=.25 | $.25\cdot{100}$=25% | 3+5=8  | .15+.25=.4 | 15%+25%=40% |
| 4     | 3   | .15              | 15%                 | 8+3=11 | .4+.15=.55 | 40%+15%=55% |
| 5     | 6   | .3               | 30%                 | 17     | .55+.3=.85 | 85%         |
| 6     | 2   | .1               | 10%                 | 19     | .95        | 95%         |
| 7     | 1   | .05              | 5%                  | 20     | 1          | 100%        |
| Total | 20  | 1                | 100%                |        |            |             |
