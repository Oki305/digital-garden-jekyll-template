# Class Width
Also called <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Amplitude</mark> , represented with an $A$.
The distance between the [[Lower Class Limit]]s of the consecutive classes. So the set in between these limits is the class range.
$$A={R\over{K}}$$
The *amplitude* or *width* can also be calculated by using any of the following:
- Difference between real *limits*
- Difference between apparent *limits* plus a unit
- Difference between [[Class Marks]]
