# Nominal Variables
These can be placed into categories. They do not have a numeric value and can not be added, subtracted, divided, or multiplied. ==They also have no order==. If they appear to have an order then you probably have [[Ordinal Variables]] instead.
Examples:
- Gender: Male, Female, Other
- Hair Color: Brown, Black, Blonde, Red, Other
