# Stems and Leaves Diagrams
A Stem and Leaf Diagram is a special table where each data value is split into a "stem"— the first digit or digits,— and a "leaf"— the last digit.
Basically, each number in the [[Dataset]] is broken down into a *stem* and a*leaf*, thus the name. The stem of the number includes all but the last digit. **The leaf** of the number **will always be a single digit**.
For example, with the dataset $41, 40, 40, 37, 35, 34, 33, 27, 21, 13, 10$, will be organized in the following manner:

| Stem | Leaves  |
| ---- | ------- |
| 1    | 2 3     |
| 2    | 1 7     |
| 3    | 3 4 5 7 |
| 4    | 0 0 1   |
