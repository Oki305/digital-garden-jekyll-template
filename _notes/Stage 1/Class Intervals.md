# Class Intervals
Each one of the groups, or [[Class Ranges]] we discussed before.
To determine the number of Class Intervals to create, we will use the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Sturges Rule</mark> .
$$K=1+3.3\log(n)$$
Where <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">$\color{white}{K}$</mark> is the Number of Intervals, and <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">$\color{white}{n}$</mark> is the number of data.
It is expected that the number of intervals should be odd, so round up or down to the nearest odd number.

### Range
It is also required for intervals to calculate the [[Range]] of the data.
The Intervals combine with the *range* to create the [[Class Width]].
