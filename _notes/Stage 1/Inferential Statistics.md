# Inferential Statistics
Inferential Statistics are used to make predictions or comparisons about a larger group, called a [[Population]]. Most of the time, the population is very large, so we take a [[Sample]].
An [[Individual or Statistical Unit]] is each one of the elements belonging to the population that is being studied.
