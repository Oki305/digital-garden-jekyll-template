Like the [[Stems and Leaves Diagrams]], but in this case the dataset $41, 40, 40, 37, 35, 34, 33, 27, 21, 13, 10$, will be organized in the following manner:

| Double Stem | Stem & Leaves |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| 1, 1        | 2 3           |
| 2, 2        | 1 7           |
| 3, 3        | 3 4, 5 7      |
| 4, 4        | 0 0 1         |
